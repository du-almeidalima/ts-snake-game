# JS Snake Game

This is a replica of the classic Snake Game with JavaScript. Canvas "2D" was used to display the graphical UI. 
The game was built using TypeScript and OOP Concepts.

This project uses Webpack to manage the assets as well to serve the development server.

This was manly made for fun and learning :)
